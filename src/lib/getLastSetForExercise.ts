 *   - workoutStore.ts:addSet (lines 588-599)
 *   - app/workout/active/page.tsx (lines 3395-3400)

 * The original code did `for (workout of history) ... break` without sorting
 * by date, so an old workout could surface as "previous". Three independent
 * bugs:
 *   1. No sort by completion date (workouts iterated in array order)
 *   2. No filter on status === 'completed' (drafts could match)
 *   3. No filter on !deletedAt (soft-deleted workouts scanned)
 *
 * Type fields used here:
 *   - Workout.endTime (set when workout finishes) — preferred sort key
 *   - Workout.startTime (always set on creation) — fallback sort key
 *   - Workout.status === 'completed'
 *   - Workout.deletedAt undefined or null means "active"
